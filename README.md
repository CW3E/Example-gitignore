# Example-gitignore
This is repository is to provide an example of a .gitignore file that contains patterns common to many geophysical data science projects at CW3E.
This example is not exhaustive, and users are encouraged to add additional patterns and remove existing patterns as-needed.

You can find a much wider collection of example patterns and templates for common project types at the
[Official Github gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
