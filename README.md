# Example-gitignore
This is repository is to provide an example of a .gitignore file that contains patterns common to many geophysical data science projects at CW3E.

## Instructions
Copy the [.gitignore](https://github.com/CW3E/Example-gitignore/blob/main/.gitignore) file from this repository to your new repository before adding codes.  
This example is not exhaustive, and users may need to add additional patterns and remove existing patterns for their specific project. 

A much wider collection of example patterns and templates for common project types at the
[Official Github gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
